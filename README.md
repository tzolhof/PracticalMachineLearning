# PracticalMachineLearning

This is the Final Project for the Practical Machine Learning Coursera's Course.

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who 
take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are 
tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify
how well they do it. 

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. Six participants were asked to 
perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. The goal of this Final Project is to predict the manner in
which they did the exercise, using data from accelerometers on their belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell.
